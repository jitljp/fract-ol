Zoom the fractal view in or out, centered on the mouse position.
- (x, y): pixel coordinates of the mouse cursor in the window.
- zoom: scale factor (<1 zooms in, >1 zooms out).
The function maps (x, y) into complex-plane coordinates (mouse_x, mouse_y),
then rescales the current rectangle [min_r..max_r, min_i..max_i] around that
point so the cursor stays fixed during zoom. Finally, it calls update_iters()
to adjust iteration count based on the new zoom level.

Mouse event handler for zooming.
Triggered by MiniLibX when a mouse button/wheel event occurs

- x, y: cursor coordinates in the window at event time,
- f: fractal state/context.
If scroll up: zooms in (scale 0.9) centered on cursor position.
If scroll down: zooms out (scale 1/0.9) centered on cursor.
After adjusting the viewport, calls push_image() to redraw.
Always returns 0 to match MLXâ€™s expected hook signature.
